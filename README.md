# ReactiveUIified UWP Template Studio Project

Integrating ReactiveUI into a UWP project built with Windows Template Studio

## Overview

[Windows Template Studio](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsTemplateStudio) allows you choose a design pattern from a selection of popular frameworks - currently Code Behind, MVVM Basic, MVVM Light, Caliburn.Micro, and Prism - for the foundation of your project. These are some quality options, but there's one, in particular, that I'd love to see added: [**ReactiveUI**](https://reactiveui.net/).

Until that becomes a reality, though, I thought I'd try my hand at integrating ReactiveUI into a project built with Template Studio.

## Details

I started out simple with just a few pages to navigate between, and plan to gradually add more.

#### Initial Wizard Selections

- **Project Type:** Navigation pane (hamburger menu)
- **Framework:** MVVM Light
- **Pages:** Blank, Master/Detail, Settings
- **Features:** Settings Storage
